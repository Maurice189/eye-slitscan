== Installation ==
Run the bootstrap file (will require sudo since some packages are installed to make sure all prerequisites are met).

It will download and install all dependencies, namely:
- sally (https://github.com/rieck/sally.git)
- liblinear (https://github.com/cjlin1/liblinear.git)
- Yarbus data (http://ilab.usc.edu/borji/Yarbus.zip)
- some unix libraries and tools (gcc libz-dev libconfig8-dev libarchive-dev git automake autoconf libtool)

Please note that these programs and data come with their own licenses and restrictions for use. This script can only collect them for your convenvience - the tools and data are not part of this script.

Afterwards MATLAB will be started and the run.m file is executed.

== What happens internally (SubsMatch2.0 ) ==
The MATLAB script batchDefendingYarbus.m loads experiment data (Yarbus by Borji) and performs string conversion via the kernelSAX script. Resulting string-encoded scanpaths are saved to Yarbus/*.lines.
In the next step batchDefendingYarbus.m invokes the sally program on these files and thereby constructs the subsequences, conuts and normalizes them. The results are saved to Yarbus/*.libsvm
The last step is calling libLinear on these input features. Different alphabet and n-gram lengths are used to show the effect of parameter choice.

== Troubleshooting ==
The MATLAB mex compiler is used. you might need to configure it to use a MATLAB compatible GCC and g++ version.
https://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/changing-default-compiler.html
You might need to install a GCC and G++ version 4.7 or earlier, e.g., sudo apt-get install gcc-4.7 g++-4.7
In liblinear/matlab/make.m change the calls to mex (lines 13-16) to:
mex -v GCC='/usr/bin/gcc-4.7 CFLAGS=...
mex -v GCC='/usr/bin/gcc-4.7 CFLAGS=...
mex -v GXX='/usr/bin/g++-4.7 CFLAGS=...
mex -v GXX='/usr/bin/g++-4.7 CFLAGS=...
